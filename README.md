## Rock, Spock, Paper, Lizard, Scissors Practice Project


### One popular five-weapon expansion is "rock paper scissors Spock lizard", invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla,[89] which adds "Spock" and "lizard" to the standard three choices. "Spock" is signified with the Star Trek Vulcan salute, while "lizard" is shown by forming the hand into a sock-puppet-like mouth. Spock smashes scissors and vaporizes rock; he is poisoned by lizard and disproved by paper. Lizard poisons Spock and eats paper; it is crushed by rock and decapitated by scissors. This variant was mentioned in a 2005 article in The Times of London[90] and was later the subject of an episode of the American sitcom The Big Bang Theory in 2008.
